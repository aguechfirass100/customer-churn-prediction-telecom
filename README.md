# Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Sector Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a customer churn prediction model for the telecom sector using machine learning techniques. The project is based on three key research papers, focusing on identifying factors contributing to customer churn and building predictive models. The dataset, provided in the project, includes customer demographics, usage patterns, and service history. The goal is to predict churn and help telecom companies implement targeted retention strategies.

The three research papers referenced in the project are:

1. **Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Sector Using Machine Learning Techniques**
2. **Implementing Machine Learning Techniques for Customer Retention and Churn Prediction in Telecommunications**
3. **Explaining Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry Using Tabular Machine Learning Models**

### Key elements of the project:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC, and AUC
- Reproducibility of results based on the steps outlined in the research papers
- Following the CRISP-DM methodology for end-to-end data mining

The project aims to not only reproduce results but also explore potential enhancements in churn prediction accuracy.
